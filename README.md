# Tagger

Discord Bot implementation of real time 24/7 week long survival tag game: Humans Vs Zombies. This bot is a method of managing HvZ games in person using Discord to give control over your games back to your mod team (and stop forcing them to rely on other tools).

This code is historical and no longer supported, and is left here as a starting point for reimplementation. Since the development of this package, Discord's commands system has changed and discord.py (the module used to create this bot) has also. Be advised that this code will likely not work as is. This repository has also been de-identified which will break some functionality.

This bot was made to be used by non-technical volunteers and was not intended to be developed upon or tinkered with. A simple, non-technical, readme can be found in the repository that describes how to use it and also describes how to reimport your own data for running games.
